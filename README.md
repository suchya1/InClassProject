### About Me
My computer science experience includes a minor in my undergraduate and I’m in my third and final semester of my master’s program. I have taken computer science I,II, III, and assembly language and architecture at the undergraduate level. In my masters I have taken cryptography, artificial intelligence, database design, operating systems, algorithms, and data science. This semester I am currently taking this class as well as cloud computing, functional programming and foundations of computer science. I am most familiar with java;
 however I know some python and I am currently learning lisp for as well as html, css, bootstrap and many more for this class. 
 
I see myself using my knowledge from this class in the future by taking programs I make and making them web based. I also see myself spending spare time making some cool, interactive websites out of personal interest. I have never done any web programming before so I’m very excited to learn a new useful skill.
